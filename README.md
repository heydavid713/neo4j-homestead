# neo4j-homestead
This script helps you setup Neo4J in your Homestead machine. 

The script assumes that you already have the basic setup for Homestead, if you don't have it set up or are not sure you can follow the guide in [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead) and complete your installation.

Once you have a website running you can access the Neo4J Browser by visiting your app url in the port 7474 (or another one that you may have defined) like so: 

> http://homestead.app:7474

To help you get started with Laravel and Neo4J I have been using the [NeoEloquent](https://github.com/Vinelab/NeoEloquent) library.   

If there are any issues or improvements to the setup script, feel free to send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/heydavid713/neo4j-homestead/pulls) or open an [Issue](https://github.com/heydavid713/neo4j-homestead/issues).
